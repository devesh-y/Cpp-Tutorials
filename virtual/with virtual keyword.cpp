//On applying virtual keyword
//Which version of function(of same  name in different derived class)  does the compiler call?   
//In fact the compiler doesnâ€™t know what to do, so it arranges for the decision to be deferred until the program is running.
//This is called late binding or dynamic binding.
//(Choosing functions in the normal way, during compilation, is called early binding or static binding.)
